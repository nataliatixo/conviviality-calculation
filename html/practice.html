            Our next book club session will be on May 17. This time it is based on the pivotal book from 1973: Tools for Conviviality 
            by Ivan Illich.

            The book reads as a theoretical and practical proposal on how we can repurpose technology as a means rather than an end to 
            realizing ourselves. It is a positive encouragement to share and help each other create systems that are transparent and in 
            return strengthen our ability to build things. It also urges us to rethink a system that places at its center the idea that 
            technology must advance, machines have to take over and that infinite growth and revenue increase is not only possible, but 
            a noble goal in and of itself.

            This book is one of those kinds of works that are quoted over and over. Especially in discussions where optimism and clarity 
            on where we should go with technology is called for. It encourages to look constructively at the mess we've made of our 
            modern world. More busy with building up ideas than tearing down old ones, this is a book that we hope will foster a 
            discussion about the tools of technology and how we can make them our own.

            Details: Tools for Conviviality is a small book of just 126 pages, available on the internet as a pdf if you google it. 
            This session will, believe it or not, be out first held online! Two hours as usual, but this time on Zoom. Please sign 
            up to secure a limited spot, and do remember to give notice if you cannot make it.
