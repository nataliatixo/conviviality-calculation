          Camp Hex is an inclusive and creative hacker summer camp that has taken place since 2017 and organised by a couple of activist, music and tech communities. For 2021, we would like to meet for a weekend in May in a small group in an old Swedish school-turned artist community called Siggalycka. Camp hex is a participant-driven event, where the people who take part also deliver the agenda for the camp. Previous years, the topics for workshops have been: making a computer game, creating your own bots, making electronic music, meme workshop, digital defense and encryption, hardware projects, intro to programming, weaving workshop. Parts of camp Hex could take place online, such as workshops, lectures.
